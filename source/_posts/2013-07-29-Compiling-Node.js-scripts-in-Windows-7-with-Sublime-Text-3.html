<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><p>This is a continuation of <a href="http://www.thefourtheye.in/2013/07/Compiling-Cpp-11-Programs-with-Sublime-Text-3.html">Compiling CPP 11 Programs with Sublime Text 3 in Ubuntu</a> where we saw how to configure Sublime Text 3 in Ubuntu 13.04 to compile C++ 11 programs. In this post, we ll see how to execute Node.js programs in Windows 7 machine's Sublime Text 3. I am going to assume that Node.js is installed properly and PATH variable is also set properly. If you are using Windows Installer, we dont have to worry about this. <br /><ol><li>We need to create the following directory structure in the User's home directory <code>AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\JS\</code>. In my machine, home directory is <code>C:\Users\[username]</code>. To know the current user's home directory, open <code>Cmd.exe</code> and type <code>echo %userprofile%</code>. <br /><li>In that directory, create a file called "JS.sublime-build". So, the location of the file from the home directory is <code>AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\JS\JS.sublime-build</code> You can name the sublime-build file as anything you want. I have simply named it here as JS.<br /><li>Copy and paste the following text in to it.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">{<br /> "cmd": ["node.exe", "${file}"],<br /> "file_regex": "^(..[^:]*):([0-9]+):?([0-9]+)?:? (.*)$",<br /> "working_dir": "${file_path}",<br /> "selector": "source.js",<br /> "variants":<br /> [<br />  {<br />   "name": "Run",<br />   "cmd":["node.exe", "${file}"]<br />  }<br /> ]<br />}<br /></pre><li>Thats it. Open Sublime Text 3. Click on Tools->Build System. You should see JS as one of the options. From now on, you can execute node.js scripts simply by pressing Ctrl-B.<br /></ol></div></div>
