<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />Today I came across this useful trick, which allows me to have lot of space on my screen, even though my screen supports only very low resolution.<br /><br />First, lets see how to get to know the list of displays attached to Ubuntu<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint">~$ xrandr<br />Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 2881 x 1280, maximum 16384 x 16384<br />VGA-0 connected 1600x1280+1281+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 376mm x 301mm<br />   1280x1024      60.0*+   75.0  <br />   1152x864       75.0  <br />   1024x768       75.0     60.0  <br />   800x600        75.0     60.3  <br />   640x480        75.0     59.9  <br />LVDS-0 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)<br />   1600x900       60.0 +   40.0  <br />DP-0 connected 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 376mm x 301mm<br />   1280x1024      60.0*+   75.0  <br />   1152x864       75.0  <br />   1024x768       75.0     60.0  <br />   800x600        75.0     60.3  <br />   640x480        75.0     59.9  <br />DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)<br />HDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)<br />DP-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)<br />DP-3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)<br />~$ <br /></pre><br />This is what I got on my machine. And following are the display names as per Ubuntu.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">VGA-0 <br />LVDS-0<br />DP-0 <br /></pre><br />This command has listed out other useful information as well. I could only understand the resolutions supported. Following are the resolutions supported by VGA-0 and DP-0.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">1280x1024<br />1152x864<br />1024x768<br /> 800x600<br /> 640x480<br /></pre>So the maximum resolution allowed is 1280x1024. But that doesnot allow me to have more space on screen. After long searching, I got this.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">xrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1280x1024 --scale 1.25x1.25<br /></pre>This command sets the resolution of VGA-0, to 1280x1024 but it scales it by the factor of 1.25x1.25. Voila :) Now I have much bigger screen.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
