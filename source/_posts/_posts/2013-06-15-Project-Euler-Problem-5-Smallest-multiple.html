<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today I came across this interesting problem. <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=5">Project Euler's Problem 5 - Smallest Multiple</a>. <br /><br /><pre>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.<br /><br />What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?<br /></pre><br />Definitely 20! (factorial of 20) is one, which will be evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20. But the problem is to find the <b>smallest</b> positive number. So, I thought, it would be the number which is the product of all the prime numbers within 20. I calculated <code>2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 9699690</code>, which is wrong, since a number divisible by 2 might not be divisible by 4 and the same applies for other prime numbers and their multiples. After little thinking, I couldn’t get a way to find the solution. So I applied brute force and my solution got accepted.<br /><br /><h2>Brute Force Solution</h2><br /><pre class="prettyprint">i = 21<br />while True:<br />    flag = True<br />    for X in xrange(1, 21):<br />        if (i % X != 0):<br />            flag = False<br />            break<br />    if flag:<br />        print i<br />        break<br />    i += 1<br /></pre><br />But the problem with this solution is, the time taken to produce the result. It took 162 seconds or 2 minutes and 32 seconds. I wondered if I can improve my solution to produce solution in a reasonable amount of time. I couldn’t, so I googled and got this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13765976/1903116">page</a>. Its high school maths. <br /><br /><h2>Optimized Solution</h2><br /><h2>LCM</h2>Least Common Divisor (LCM) of numbers A and B, is a number which is the least number divisible by both A & B. Moreover LCM (A, B, C) = LCM (LCM (A, B), C) and so on.<br /><br /><h2>Relation between LCM and GCD</h2><code>LCM(A,B) = (A * B)/GCD(A*B)</code><br /><br /><h2>Recursive Euclid's algorithm for GCD</h2><h6>Base Condition</h6><code>GCD(A, 0) = A</code><br /><h6>Recurrence Relation</h6><code>GCD(A, B) = GCD (B, A mod B)</code><br /><br />So I modified my code like this and it produced the solution within 1 second.<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint">def GCD(M, N):<br />    while (N != 0):<br />        M, N = N, M % N<br />    return M<br /><br />LCM = 1<br />for X in xrange(1, 21):<br />    LCM = (X * LCM)/GCD(X, LCM)<br />print LCM<br /></pre><br /><br /></div></div>
