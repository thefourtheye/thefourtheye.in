<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="color: black;">Lately I have been working with Google Chrome, browsing random stuff. All of a sudden found something weird in the browser. I was searching for a word in the page displayed on screen. It searches properly but the index with which it reports the matches has got negative values. (See the attached screenprint) I was keep on trying to reproduce the same, after reopening the browser, but unfortunately I am not successful yet. I think this happens when I am searching in multiple pages at the same time. Browser decrements the value instead of resetting it when the current index is 1, when user clicks on upward arrowed button.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3NBpRg4JX9k/UG_cSFzRWhI/AAAAAAAAAyo/yn-KzblY8JM/s1600/Google+Chrome+Search+Bar+Bug.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3NBpRg4JX9k/UG_cSFzRWhI/AAAAAAAAAyo/yn-KzblY8JM/s640/Google+Chrome+Search+Bar+Bug.png" width="640" /></a></div></div></div>
