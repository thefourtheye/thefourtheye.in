<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">After upgrading to Ubuntu 13.04, I was facing this problem. I was not able to execute any script file just by double clicking on it, even though it has execute permission. Then I figured out, how to fix this problem.<br /><br />I opened the file explorer <code>Files</code>. Pressed <code>Alt</code>+<code>F10</code> and selected <code>Preferences</code>. It showed something like this.<br /><br /><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I74gD.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I74gD.png" /></a><br /><br />In the <code>Behavior</code> tab, I selected <code>Ask each time</code> and closed it. By default, it was in <code>View executable text files when they are opened</code>. Now whenever I double click on a shell script, it will ask me what to do. If you want to straight away execute the script, select the first option <code>Run executable text files when they are opened</code>.<br /></div></div>
